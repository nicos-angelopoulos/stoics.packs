The pack_dnloads_config_stoics.pl file in this directory is an 
example of passing options (see pack(options):options_append/3) 
via a file. 

Copy pack_dnloads_stoics.pl to user_profile('stoics/options/pack_dnloads.pl')
and edit it to list the packs you are interested in.
Each time pack(b_real):src/pack_dnloads.pl is called, it will operate on this
set of packs.

The file: user_profile('stoics/options/pack_dnloads.pl') on linux unfold to something like
/home/nicos/.config/swi-prolog/stoics/options/pack_dnloads.pl
where "nicos" would be replaced by your own username.
