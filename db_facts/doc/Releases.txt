0.4    16.12.22   FIXED: wrap use_module/1 call for backends in a catch
                         so it fails, rather than error.
0.3    16.12.22   FIXED: phone.pl example (string and code-list as argument)
                  FIXED: code-list as argument (clause was missing ConT argument?)

						FIXED: URL for uniprot.sqlite in uniprot.pl
